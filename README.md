# The Therapeutic Teacher Website - Local Development Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the Therapeutic Teacher website locally on your machine for development purposes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

### 1. Clone the Repository (if applicable)

If you received this project as a Git repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd therapeutic-teacher-multipage
```

If you received a zip file, simply unzip it and navigate into the `therapeutic-teacher-multipage` directory:

```bash
unzip therapeutic-teacher-multipage-source.zip
cd therapeutic-teacher-multipage
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses `pnpm` as its package manager. If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Once `pnpm` is installed, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

To start the local development server, run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will typically start the server at `http://localhost:5173`. You can open this URL in your web browser to see the website.

### 4. Build for Production

To create a production-ready build of the website (static files for deployment), run:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder in the project root, containing the optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These are the files you would upload to a static hosting service like GitHub Pages.
